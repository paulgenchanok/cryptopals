# Cryptopals in Go

This repo has my ongoing efforts at solving the [Cryptopals](cryptopals.com) challenges in Go. It's a work in progress. The directory structure may change as I go back and refine things. Everything is stored in one giant library for now. I like to think I'll go back and refactor it into several files for better organization.

## How-To

Run `go run .` from the home directory. Check [main.go](main.go) for which sets or challenges will run.

## Why Go?

Most folks seem to solve the Cryptopals using Python based on the number of guides available on the internet. 

I'm already fairly confident in Python and I didn't want to end up copying code already out there.

And I've wanted to learn Go because of Ken Thompson's influence on it. So Go it is.
